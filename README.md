# Sky130 Current-Mirrors

## Purpose
This file does not contain any substantial work; it merely consists the work of
getting used to know the analog workflow using Skywater 130 and Xschem for
analog IC design.

## Simulate
If you correctly load the Skywater spice models in your `xschemrc` file you
should be ready to simulate straight away.

## Plotting Results
As I have not yet gotten used to Xschem's way of portraying results, I am
experimenting using a Python-based workflow to plot results and investigate the
performance.
